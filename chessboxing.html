                                Chessboxing is a hybrid that combines two traditional pastimes: chess and boxing. The competitors compete in alternating rounds of chess and boxing.

                            <p>
                                The basic idea in Chessboxing is to combine the number one thinking sport with the number one
                                fighting sport into a hybrid that demands the most of its competitors - both mentally and
                                physically. One of the goals of this new sport is the old idea of a healthy mind in a healthy
                                body. During a Chessboxing fight, the control of aggression plays a big role.

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>What is chessboxing and how did it become a sport? (ESPN The Ocho)</i></p>
                        </div>
                    <div class="history-content">Chessboxing was invented by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh. Rubingh's idea to create a
                        new sport fusing the two disciplines, chess and boxing, originates from the 1992 comic <i>"Froid
                        Équateur"</i> (written by French comic book artist Enki Bilal) that portrays a chessboxing world
                        championship.
                        <br><br>
                        The first chessboxing competition took place in Berlin in 2003. That same year, the first world
                        championship fight was held in Amsterdam in cooperation with the Dutch Boxing Association as
                        well as the Dutch Chess Federation and under the auspices of the World Chess Boxing Organization
                        (WCBO) that was founded in Berlin shortly before. Dutch middleweight fighters Iepe Rubingh and
                        Jean Louis Veenstra faced each other in the ring. After his opponent exceeded the chess time
                        limit, Rubingh won the fight in the 11th round going down in the history books as the first-ever
                        World Chess Boxing Champion. The same goes for the Chess Boxing Club Berlin, created in the
                        following year (2004), that is the first of its kind making Berlin the birthplace of
                        chessboxing.
                        <br><br>
                        In terms of its development into a mass sport, there was much success in 2013 and early 2014 for
                        the chessboxing world. There were more competitors in the second and third Indian Championships
                        in summer 2013 and early 2014 than in any chessboxing events ever before, with more than 245
                        fighters varying in both age and weight class, taking place in Salem and Jodhpur, respectively.
                        Furthermore, the chessboxing community in London has continued to grow constantly since 2011 and
                        by now stages chessboxing events for 800 or more spectators on a regular basis 4–5 times a year
                        at the Scala, King's Cross.

                    <p>In a chessboxing match, six rounds of chess alternate with five rounds of boxing. Each round lasts
                    three minutes with one-minute breaks in between to switch from the chess table to the boxing ring.
                    A chessboxing match can end by any of the following:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Victory by knockout or technical knockout in boxing</li>

                    <li>Loss due to exceeding the chess game's time control</li>
                    <li>Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity

                    In the case that neither of the chessboxers wins in regulation time and the chess game ends in a
                    draw, the fighter who is ahead on boxing points wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is
                    also tied, the fighter that used the black chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the
                    first-move advantage in chess). This has not yet occurred in practice.</p>

                    Specialized chessboxing training combines physical interval training with blitz or speed chess

                    Exercises like "track chess" and "stair chess" involve playing speed chess with intensive
                    running exercises in between.
                    Common methods include combining speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups.
                    Classic chessboxing training involves box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.
